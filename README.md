# BitHash
Unique hashing method for security built in javascript. The method can be easily transferred into PHP or other server-side languages. Ideal for storing unique hashes into a database. BitHash requires some tweaking to be utilized, such as storing the passwords into a MySQL database and adding it to login/registration pages. If you have a website which is already using a different hashing method, you'll need to send an email to all users telling them their passwords have been reset, and then resetting their passwords to a random string and including it in the email sent out. All those strings must be encrypted via BitHash for the move.
